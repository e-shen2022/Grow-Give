Grow & Give is an iOS app that not only fosters proactive minds ready to contribute to the workplace but also sets a foundation for kids to develop a sense of responsibility to give back to their community. One key feature is the "Shop," where users’ in-game coins from minutes of focus can be exchanged to nonprofits that #teamtrees and #teamseas. This leverages adolescents’ high levels of generativity--- a concern about making a difference. Our app also involves a process of planning tasks, setting goals, focusing, and reflecting to maximize focus and self-growth.

We designed by designing screens on the Xcode Storyboard. We laid out many elements like labels, buttons, and images on the screens for our app. Next, we moved on to connect IBOutlets in the front end with the backend code with Swift, allowing buttons to achieve their functions and popups to appear. We then connected the backend database with a database using the MongoDB API and created a system that stores user data.

During the design phase, we created features to plan tasks, set goals, focus, reflect, complete tasks, and the shop. We also implemented autolayout along with scroll views on every screen and label to make sure that the labels could fit on every screen size. Finally, we sent this completed product to the app store for submission.
